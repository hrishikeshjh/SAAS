## Style Guidelines:

- Left Panel Background: Gradient from dark to light green (#101A14 to #2E6153) to create depth and visual interest.
- Right Panel Background: Solid dark grey (#0F0F0F) to provide a neutral backdrop for the login elements.
- "Welcome Back" Title: Neon green (#C1F6DC) with a slight glow effect to draw attention.
- Buttons: 'SIGN IN' button features a green gradient (#00FFB2) with a hover glow effect, and 'Continue with GitHub' button is black with a green border.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, minimal look across all text elements.
- Split screen layout: Left side (60% width) and right side (40% width) to balance visual elements and login components.
- Input animations: Input fields slide in from the right with a subtle ease-in animation on page load. Add neon green underline that expands when input fields are focused.
- Background animation: The gradient background on the left panel should have animated noise or wave motion.
